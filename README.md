# CIS3130-Lab2
Description:  This program was designed to take the input of a file called 'input.csv' which consists of a textile with data from Spotifycharts.com. It then creates a report called 'out.csv' which displays the artists that appear on the list and how many times they appeared in alphabetical order.  The report consists of two columns: Artists and Frequency  This program would be ideal for record label executives that would want to see a easy concise view of which artists are currently dominating the charts.  To RUN the program:  1. Compile the program. 2. When prompted to "Enter the file name", enter 'input.csv' 3. Press ENTER 4. A message will display "Report successfully written to 'out.csv'." to verify that report was created. 5. Go back to the main folder where the 'out.csv' file should now appear. 6. Open the file and report should be displayed with artist name and frequency.  Technologies used: JGRASP
